This plugin creates an easy to use interface for managing the Supersized jQuery Plugin on your site.

== Description ==

This plugin creates an easy to use interface for managing the Supersized jQuery Plugin on your WordPress site. You have
the option to define a global set of images as well as set up an image, title, and caption on a per post basis. The per
post images will override the global images if set for a particular post.

Find a bug or have suggestions for improvment? You can contact us through our website
[Envoke Design](http://envokedesign.com/ "Web Design Portland") or create an issue using our
[Issue Tracker](https://bitbucket.org/envokedesign/envoke-supersized/issues)

== Installation ==

= Manual Installation =

1. Upload the entire `/envoke-supersized` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate Envoke Supersized through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many images can I use for my Supersized background? =

You can use as few or as many as you would like when using the Supersized Slides post type. Per post overrides currently
only support a single image, but supporting multiple images on a per post basis is a possibility in the future, if
enough people want the feature.

= What if I find a bug or have a suggestion for improvements? =

Let us know. You can contact us through our website [Envoke Design](http://envokedesign.com/ "Web Design Portland") or
create an issue using our [Issue Tracker](https://bitbucket.org/envokedesign/envoke-supersized/issues)

= Only some of my slides are loading. How can I load more? =

The plugin currently limits the number of slides that will load on any given page to 50. For most people, this is more
than plenty, but if you need to increase this, there is a filter available for this purpose - 'enss-max-images'. For
example, to increase the number of images to 75, you could add the following line to your functions.php file:
`add_filter( 'enss-max-images', function( $number ) { return 75; });`

= I was to be able to override the background for a custom post type. How can I do this? =

By default, only posts and pages have the override meta box available. To add it to other post types, you can use the
 'enss-override-post-types' filter. The filter gets passed an array of supported post types. To add one, you can just
 append the post type to the array, then return the modified array. See
 [this issue](https://bitbucket.org/envokedesign/envoke-supersized/issue/14/override-background-dont-show-in-custom)
 for an example of how to implement this.
